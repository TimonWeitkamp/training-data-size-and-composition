# training-data-size-and-composition
Effects of training data size and composition on the classification of irrigated agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa through remote sensing using four algorithms.

Python scripts are used in Digital Earth Africa sandbox (https://sandbox.digitalearth.africa/hub/login) to create the raster data. R script is used for classification. Visualisation scripts are not shared, mostly done through ggplot2.
